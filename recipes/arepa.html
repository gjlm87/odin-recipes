        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>3 cups warm or hot water</li>
           <li>2 cups of precooked corn flour</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1 tsp. olive oil</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl place the water together with the salt and the olive oil. Mix and add the flour a little at a time while continuing to stir.</li>
            <li>Once all the dough is incorporated, start mixing with your hands while the flour absorbs the liquid. If necessary add a little more flour and the final texture should be similar to a moldable mashed potato. When the desired consistency is reached, let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After this time, with the help of your hands grab balls of the dough to start shaping them rounded and then flat. Repeat this process with all the dough.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan with a little oil in the base and when it is hot place one or two arepas at a time. Cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>After this time turn them over and cook for 10 more minutes. Then repeat the cooking process with all the dough.</li>
            <li>They will be ready to fill and eat.</li>
        </ol>
