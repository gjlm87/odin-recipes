    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>6 pork milanesitas, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
       <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
       <li>1/2 glass of beer</li> 
       <li>1 egg</li>
       <li>Thyme</li>
       <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the egg, thyme, minced garlic, soy sauce and beer in a bowl. Whisk.</li>
        <li>The milanesas: ideally, they should be very thin. Salt them and pass them once through the wholemeal flour. Add them to the marinade, soak them well and let them rest for at least half an hour.</li>
        <li>Mix the breadcrumbs with the rest of the whole wheat flour. I grate the bread with the coarse part of a grater, so that there are little pieces that make them crunchier.</li>
        <li>Coat the milanesas on one side and on the other with the batter.</li>
        <li>Fry them in very hot oil until golden brown on both sides. To accompany them, I made this pumpkin and strong cheese puree.</li>
    </ol>
